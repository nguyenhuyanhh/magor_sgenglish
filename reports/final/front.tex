\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This Final-Year Project would not have been successful without the support
of my mentors, reviewers, friends and family.

I would like to extend my most sincere gratitude to my supervisor,

I would also like to thank the research staff of the Speech
and Language Research Group at the School of Computer Science and Engineering,

Above all, I would like to say thanks to my friends and family, especially to my
beloved, for your emotional support during this period and throughout my university
education.
